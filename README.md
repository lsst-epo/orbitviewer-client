# Vera Rubin â€“ OrbitViewer
This repo contains the structure of Vera Rubin's OrbitViewer front-end. 

## Scripts
The following scripts are available:

1. `yarn build` to build production-ready code.
2. `yarn dev` to launch dev mode environment.
3. `yarn clean` to clean all temp generated files & clean data cache such as Craft CMS.

When developing you can use the following url: `http://localhost:8080/` to launh the front-end.

## Known Issues
Dev mode behaves sometimes a bit buggy when launching. Usually a `yarn clean && yarn build && yarn dev` fixes things... Once running, it should run robustly.
